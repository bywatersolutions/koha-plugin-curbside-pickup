# Curbside Pickup API plugin for Koha

## Compatibility

This version of the Curbside Pickup plugin is compatible with Koha 22.11 and later.
These versions of Koha have the original functionality of this plugin built-in.

This version of the plugin exists to add a REST API for managing curbside pickups that was not included in Koha's built-in version of the feature.
